					<p>Plasma is a component of our blood. Nearly 55% of your blood is plasma. It is yellow in colour. Laboratories can separate plasma from blood with special devices called plasma tubes through a process called centrifugation.</p>
                    <h2>What makes plasma a candidate for COVID cure is that it contains antibodies. When your body has fought an infection, the antibodies produced are stored in the plasma. That means if youâ€™ve contracted COVID, then antibodies that can fight the COVID infection will be present in your plasma. The plasma from a person who has recovered from a disease is called convalescent plasma.</h2>
                   <p>Doctors have found evidence that injecting a person who has been infected with COVID with convalescent plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID can help the patient heal faster.</p>
                   <h2>Who can donate?</h2>
                      <p>Well, the first criterion of course is that you need to be a COVID survivor. You can donate 28 days after complete recovery.<br>
                      In India, women between the ages of 18-55 years can donate plasma only if they have never been pregnant.<br>
                      All male COVID survivors in the 18-55 age group can donate plasma.<br></p>
